Advanced Groups Serverside for free!!!
I am not nor have I ever claimed to be Lennard Boetcher.

My previous repository at (https://github.com/Opticoom/AdvancedGroups) was falsely taken down by Lennard Boetcher, A mirror of this repository can be found at (https://bitbucket.org/Opticoom/advancedgroups/src/main/). It made a lot of bold claims and I will now be debunking all of those said claims. The original takedown notice can be read in full at the following URL: (https://pastebin.com/6syq8qtj).

Line 11 of Lennard's DMCA request reads ("The Person writes in the README.md like he was me (the actual owner of the Content)") This is the first claim that was made in this takedown therefore I will be talking about it first. In the original readme file, I thought I made it pretty clear that I was not the person selling this software. For example, I wrote ("Obviously the ServerMod was obfuscated at first but, let's be honest-") why would I bring this up if I were claiming to be the owner. This statement is very bold and I'm confused as to why it was added in the first place.

Line 15 of Lennard's DMCA request reads ("https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2289484547&searchtext=groups PBO files can be opened with PBO Manager https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369") This is a very vague statement since it is only true if the PBO was packaged using the regular tools provided by Bohemia. It would have been impossible to extract the code shown inside of the repository using PBOManager due to the nature of how the PBO was packed. The tools used to pack the PBO's in the repository were made proprietarly with the sole purpose to bypass Bohemia's EULA and to make PBO unpackable by software such as PBOManager.

I will skip over lines 16-25 because it has nothing to do with the argument.

Line 28-29 are the real bogus lines stating ("everything of the content is licensed under Steams Workshop License except for... which are licensed as NDA and are not designed for being uploaded public") This is ridiculous as I could not find any license under "Steam Workshop License" The biggest bullshit though is in the last part of that sentence. 

UPON PURCHASING THIS SOFTWARE I DID NOT: SIGN ANY NDA, SIGN ANYTHING, AGREE TO ANY LICENCE OR EULA, AGREE TO A TOS. I was not asked for ANY OF THESE. THIS MEANS THAT I AM NOT LEGALLY BOUND TO ANYTHING.

Lennard Boetcher does not even know my name but yet I was able to buy his software from him. He does not publish anything attributing him to any form of company nor does he have any form of licensing. He is lacking the proper requirements to even operate a business in Germany. None of this is legally binding therefore this DMCA request WAS A FALSE TAKEDOWN.

I will play nice with Lennard though since according to him the only files that were not under "Steams Workshop License" were "LBmaster_GroupsServer_nolicencingserver" and "LBmaster_GroupsServer_orig." He claims these files are under an NDA (Non-Disclosure-Agreement) which is false. If that were to be the case then sue me, I have never, nor will I ever sign shit for you.


Love, Elijah (FlipperOver)
